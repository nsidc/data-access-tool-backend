Documentation is written as markdown and rendered as a website using
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

To contribute documentation, update an existing markdown file in `doc/`, or add
a new one.

If adding a new one, include it in the `navbar` entry in `docs/_quarto.yml`.

Preview your changes with:

```bash
quarto preview doc/
```
