# Software Architecture

![High-level software architecture diagram for the DAT. The DAT is embedded in
dataset-specific pages powered by Drupal. Drupal provides the DAT with the
dataset name and version. The DAT then uses NASA CMR to query for dataset
metadata.](high_level_architecture.png)

# Future Evolution

NSIDC DAAC plans to collaborate with teams across the NASA Earth Science Data
Systems program to scale the DAT into an enterprise tool, with the goal of
serving all NASA Earthdata datasets as an integrated application within the NASA
Earthdata website.
